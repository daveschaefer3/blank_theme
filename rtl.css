Theme Name: Shape
 
Adding support for language written in a Right To Left (RTL) direction is easy -
it's just a matter of overwriting all the horizontal positioning attributes
of your CSS stylesheet in a separate stylesheet file named rtl.css.

/* RTL is for right to left language support (ie. Hebrew)
	More horizontal styles should be gone through and manually "flipped" and tested to actually support these languages.
